The pupose of the cascade control is alleviating the motion-induced vibration after the rest-to-rest motion of a class of the underactuated manipulator. Here shows the effectiveness by examples. Two agents trained by the DDPG and the PPO and two controllers, the PD and the APD, are tested in two virtual environments, the double pendulum crane and the two-links flexible manipulator. We simpilify the code so that there only reqires three basic packages to run the example. The authors used Python 3.7, and the packages are listed as follows. 
numpy      1.18.1
tensorflow 1.15.2
matplotlib 3.1.3
